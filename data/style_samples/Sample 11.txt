Hi buddy,
You started the new course now and that is very good decision. In starting it may feel little difficult but slowly you will understand everything. Don’t skip the practice and keep learning daily. After some time you will see big improvement. I am always there if you need help. Study well and keep going.
Your friend,
Atharv
